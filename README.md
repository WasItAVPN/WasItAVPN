# Was it a VPN
This repo is meant for website owners that have interest in knowing what what visitors are using a VPN.
## Use cases
1. To prevent blocking VPN instead of users
2. To display "Use VPN alert" on torrent sites
3. To detect spam
And many more.....

## What can I expect from the CSV
We developed a special method to detect VPN services. 
In the CSV you can find all VPN services that we have seen at least once in the last two weeks.
